//! Types and traits for radix sorting.
//!
//! The current offerings are
//!
//! * LSBRadixSorter: A least-significant byte radix sorter.
//! * MSBRadixSorter: A most-significant byte radix sorter.
//! * LSBSWCRadixSorter: A least-significant byte radix sorter with software write combining.
//!
//! There should probably be a `MSBSWCRadixSorter` in the future, because I like both of those things.

/// Functionality provided by a radix sorter.
///
/// These radix sorters allow you to specify a radix key function with each method call, so that
/// the sorter does not need to reflect this (hard to name) type in its own type. This means you
/// need to take some care and not abuse this.
///
/// Internally the sorters manage data using blocks `Vec<T>`, and are delighted to consume data
/// in block form (they will reuse the blocks), and will return results as a sequence of blocks
/// such that if they are traversed in-order they are appropriately sorted.
///
/// Most of the sorters manage a stash of buffers (ideally: 256) that they use when sorting the
/// data. If this stash goes dry the sorters will allocate, but they much prefer to re-use buffers
/// whenever possible, and if having consulted your sorted results you would like to return the
/// buffers (using either `recycle` or `rebalance`) you should! The `rebalance` method allows you
/// to control just how many buffers the sorter is sitting on.
