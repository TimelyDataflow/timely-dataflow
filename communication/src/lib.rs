//! A simple communication infrastructure providing typed exchange channels.
//!
//! This crate is part of the timely dataflow system, used primarily for its inter-worker communication.
//! It may be independently useful, but it is separated out mostly to make clear boundaries in the project.
//!
//! Threads are spawned with an [`allocator::Generic`](allocator::generic::Generic), whose
//! [`allocate`](Allocate::allocate) method returns a pair of several send endpoints and one
//! receive endpoint. Messages sent into a send endpoint will eventually be received by the corresponding worker,
//! if it receives often enough. The point-to-point channels are each FIFO, but with no fairness guarantees.
//!
//! To be communicated, a type must implement the [`Bytesable`] trait.
//!
//! Channel endpoints also implement a lower-level `push` and `pull` interface (through the [`Push`] and [`Pull`]
//! traits), which is used for more precise control of resources.
//!
//! # Examples
//! ```
//! use timely_communication::{Allocate, Bytesable};
//! 
//! /// A wrapper that indicates `bincode` as the serialization/deserialization strategy.
//! pub struct Message {
//!     /// Text contents.
//!     pub payload: String,
//! }
//! 
//! impl Bytesable for Message {
//!     fn from_bytes(bytes: timely_bytes::arc::Bytes) -> Self {
//!         Message { payload: std::str::from_utf8(&bytes[..]).unwrap().to_string() }
//!     }
//! 
//!     fn length_in_bytes(&self) -> usize {
//!         self.payload.len()
//!     }
//! 
//!     fn into_bytes<W: ::std::io::Write>(&self, writer: &mut W) {
//!         writer.write_all(self.payload.as_bytes()).unwrap();
//!     }
//! }
//! 
//! fn main() {
//! 
//!     // extract the configuration from user-supplied arguments, initialize the computation.
//!     let config = timely_communication::Config::from_args(std::env::args()).unwrap();
//!     let guards = timely_communication::initialize(config, |mut allocator| {
//! 
//!         println!("worker {} of {} started", allocator.index(), allocator.peers());
//! 
//!         // allocates a pair of senders list and one receiver.
//!         let (mut senders, mut receiver) = allocator.allocate(0);
//! 
//!         // send typed data along each channel
//!         for i in 0 .. allocator.peers() {
//!             senders[i].send(Message { payload: format!("hello, {}", i)});
//!             senders[i].done();
//!         }
//! 
//!         // no support for termination notification,
//!         // we have to count down ourselves.
//!         let mut received = 0;
//!         while received < allocator.peers() {
//! 
//!             allocator.receive();
//! 
//!             if let Some(message) = receiver.recv() {
//!                 println!("worker {}: received: <{}>", allocator.index(), message.payload);
//!                 received += 1;
//!             }
//! 
//!             allocator.release();
//!         }
//! 
//!         allocator.index()
//!     });
//! 
//!     // computation runs until guards are joined or dropped.
//!     if let Ok(guards) = guards {
//!         for guard in guards.join() {
//!             println!("result: {:?}", guard);
//!         }
//!     }
//!     else { println!("error in computation"); }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This should produce output like:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! worker 0 started
//! worker 1 started
//! worker 0: received: <hello, 0>
//! worker 1: received: <hello, 1>
//! worker 0: received: <hello, 0>
//! worker 1: received: <hello, 1>
//! result: Ok(0)
//! result: Ok(1)
//! ```
