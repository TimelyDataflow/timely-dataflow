//! A simple communication infrastructure providing typed exchange channels.
//!
//! This crate is part of the timely dataflow system, used primarily for its inter-worker communication.
//! It may be independently useful, but it is separated out mostly to make clear boundaries in the project.
//!
//! Threads are spawned with an [`allocator::Generic`](allocator::generic::Generic), whose
//! [`allocate`](Allocate::allocate) method returns a pair of several send endpoints and one
//! receive endpoint. Messages sent into a send endpoint will eventually be received by the corresponding worker,
//! if it receives often enough. The point-to-point channels are each FIFO, but with no fairness guarantees.
//!
//! To be communicated, a type must implement the [`Serialize`](serde::Serialize) trait.
//!
//! Channel endpoints also implement a lower-level `push` and `pull` interface (through the [`Push`](Push) and [`Pull`](Pull)
//! traits), which is used for more precise control of resources.
//!
//! # Examples
//! ```
//! use timely_communication::Allocate;
//!
//! // configure for two threads, just one process.
//! let config = timely_communication::Config::Process(2);
//!
//! // initializes communication, spawns workers
//! let guards = timely_communication::initialize(config, |mut allocator| {
//!     println!("worker {} started", allocator.index());
//!
//!     // allocates a pair of senders list and one receiver.
//!     let (mut senders, mut receiver) = allocator.allocate(0);
//!
//!     // send typed data along each channel
//!     use timely_communication::Message;
//!     senders[0].send(Message::from_typed(format!("hello, {}", 0)));
//!     senders[1].send(Message::from_typed(format!("hello, {}", 1)));
//!
//!     // no support for termination notification,
//!     // we have to count down ourselves.
//!     let mut expecting = 2;
//!     while expecting > 0 {
//!
//!         allocator.receive();
//!         if let Some(message) = receiver.recv() {
//!             use std::ops::Deref;
//!             println!("worker {}: received: <{}>", allocator.index(), message.deref());
//!             expecting -= 1;
//!         }
//!         allocator.release();
//!     }
//!
//!     // optionally, return something
//!     allocator.index()
//! });
//!
//! // computation runs until guards are joined or dropped.
//! if let Ok(guards) = guards {
//!     for guard in guards.join() {
//!         println!("result: {:?}", guard);
//!     }
//! }
//! else { println!("error in computation"); }
//! ```
//!
//! The should produce output like:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! worker 0 started
//! worker 1 started
//! worker 0: received: <hello, 0>
//! worker 1: received: <hello, 1>
//! worker 0: received: <hello, 0>
//! worker 1: received: <hello, 1>
//! result: Ok(0)
//! result: Ok(1)
//! ```
