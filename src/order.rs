//! Traits and types for partially ordered sets.

/// A type that is partially ordered.
///
/// This trait is distinct from Rust's `PartialOrd` trait, because the implementation
/// of that trait precludes a distinct `Ord` implementation. We need an independent
/// trait if we want to have a partially ordered type that can also be sorted.
pub trait PartialOrder : Eq {
    /// Returns true iff one element is strictly less than the other.
    fn less_than(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
        self.less_equal(other) && self != other
    }
    /// Returns true iff one element is less than or equal to the other.
    fn less_equal(&self, other: &Self) -> bool;
}

/// A type that is totally ordered.
///
/// This trait is a "carrier trait", in the sense that it adds no additional functionality
/// over `PartialOrder`, but instead indicates that the `less_than` and `less_equal` methods
/// are total, meaning that `x.less_than(&y)` is equivalent to `!y.less_equal(&x)`.
///
/// This trait is distinct from Rust's `Ord` trait, because several implementors of
/// `PartialOrd` also implement `Ord` for efficient canonicalization, deduplication,
/// and other sanity-maintaining operations.
