//! Timely dataflow is a framework for managing and executing data-parallel dataflow computations.
//!
//! The code is organized in crates and modules that are meant to depend as little as possible on each other.
//!
//! **Serialization**: Timely uses the `bincode` crate for serialization. Performance could be improved.
//!
//! **Communication**: The [`timely_communication`] crate defines several primitives for
//! communicating between dataflow workers, and across machine boundaries.
//!
//! **Progress tracking**: The [`timely::progress`](progress) module defines core dataflow structures for
//! tracking and reporting progress in a timely dataflow system, namely the number of outstanding
//! dataflow messages and un-exercised message capabilities throughout the timely dataflow graph.
//! It depends on `timely_communication` to exchange progress messages.
//!
//! **Dataflow construction**: The [`timely::dataflow`](dataflow) module defines an example dataflow system
//! using `communication` and `progress` to both exchange data and progress information, in support
//! of an actual data-parallel timely dataflow computation. It depends on `timely_communication` to
//! move data, and `timely::progress` to provide correct operator notifications.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The following is a hello-world dataflow program.
//!
//! ```
//! use timely::*;
//! use timely::dataflow::operators::{Input, Inspect};
//!
//! // construct and execute a timely dataflow
//! timely::execute_from_args(std::env::args(), |worker| {
//!
//!     // add an input and base computation off of it
//!     let mut input = worker.dataflow(|scope| {
//!         let (input, stream) = scope.new_input();
//!         stream.inspect(|x| println!("hello {:?}", x));
//!         input
//!     });
//!
//!     // introduce input, advance computation
//!     for round in 0..10 {
//!         input.send(round);
//!         input.advance_to(round + 1);
//!         worker.step();
//!     }
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! The program uses `timely::execute_from_args` to spin up a computation based on command line arguments
//! and a closure specifying what each worker should do, in terms of a handle to a timely dataflow
//! `Scope` (in this case, `root`). A `Scope` allows you to define inputs, feedback
//! cycles, and dataflow subgraphs, as part of building the dataflow graph of your dreams.
//!
//! In this example, we define a new scope of root using `scoped`, add an exogenous
//! input using `new_input`, and add a dataflow `inspect` operator to print each observed record.
//! We then introduce input at increasing rounds, indicate the advance to the system (promising
//! that we will introduce no more input at prior rounds), and step the computation.
