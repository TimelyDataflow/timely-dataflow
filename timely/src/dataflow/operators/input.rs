// TODO : This is an exogenous input, but it would be nice to wrap a Subgraph in something
// TODO : more like a harness, with direct access to its inputs.

// NOTE : This only takes a &self, not a &mut self, which works but is a bit weird.
// NOTE : Experiments with &mut indicate that the borrow of 'a lives for too long.
// NOTE : Might be able to fix with another lifetime parameter, say 'c: 'a.
