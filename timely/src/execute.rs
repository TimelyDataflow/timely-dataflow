/// Executes a single-threaded timely dataflow computation.
///
/// The `example` method takes a closure on a `Scope` which it executes to initialize and run a
/// timely dataflow computation on a single thread. This method is intended for use in examples,
/// rather than programs that may need to run across multiple workers.
///
/// The `example` method returns whatever the single worker returns from its closure.
/// This is often nothing, but the worker can return something about the data it saw in order to
/// test computations.
///
/// The method aggressively unwraps returned `Result<_>` types.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// The simplest example creates a stream of data and inspects it.
///
/// ```rust
/// use timely::dataflow::operators::{ToStream, Inspect};
///
/// timely::example(|scope| {
///     (0..10).to_stream(scope)
///            .inspect(|x| println!("seen: {:?}", x));
/// });
/// ```
///
/// This next example captures the data and displays them once the computation is complete.
///
/// More precisely, the example captures a stream of events (receiving batches of data,
/// updates to input capabilities) and displays these events.
///
/// ```rust
/// use timely::dataflow::operators::{ToStream, Inspect, Capture};
/// use timely::dataflow::operators::capture::Extract;
///
/// let data = timely::example(|scope| {
///     (0..10).to_stream(scope)
///            .inspect(|x| println!("seen: {:?}", x))
///            .capture()
/// });
///
/// // the extracted data should have data (0..10) at timestamp 0.
/// assert_eq!(data.extract()[0].1, (0..10).collect::<Vec<_>>());
/// ```
